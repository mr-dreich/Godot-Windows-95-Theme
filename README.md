# Godot-Windows-95-Theme

A WIP Windows 95 Godot Theme for Application and Game development.

Currently broken when used as an Editor Theme.

The screenshot was created using [ViolinBG's Godot Desktop Theme](https://github.com/violinbg/godot-desktop-themes)

Had trouble finding a not-blurry, non-bitmap version of MS Sans Serif, the typeface used in Windows 95. So I used [Pixel Operator](https://www.dafont.com/pixel-operator.font) instead.
