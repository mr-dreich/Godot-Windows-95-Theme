# Godot-Windows-95-Theme

A WIP windows 95 godot 3.x theme for application and game development.

Currently broken when used as an editor theme.

The screenshot was created using [ViolinBG's Godot Desktop Theme](https://github.com/violinbg/godot-desktop-themes)

Had trouble finding a not-blurry, non-bitmap version of MS Sans Serif, the typeface used in Windows 95. So I used [Pixel Operator](https://www.dafont.com/pixel-operator.font) instead.
